Identifying customer segmentation is essential for creating targeted marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction and retention, optimizing resources, 
enhancing product development, gaining competitive advantage, and ultimately increasing profitability. 
It enables businesses to understand their customers on a deeper level and deliver more personalized and effective solutions.
In this study, I apply the CUSTOMER 360 theory, RFM model, and BCG matrix synergistically to analyze the data, generate meaningful insights and ultimately 
classify customer segments.
This report also highlights the significance of each customer segment and provides strategic recommendations.
Implementing:
- Transforming raw data about customer from their customer 360 profile into useful information.
- Cleaning and standardization a dataset of 114,081 records (using Python, SQL).
