Identifying customer segmentation is essential for creating targeted marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction and retention, optimizing resources, 
enhancing product development, gaining competitive advantage, and ultimately increasing profitability.

classify customer segments.
This report also highlights the significance of each customer segment and provides strategic recommendations.
